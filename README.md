# Correction-for-non-random-sampling
Correction for non-random sampling under the BiSSE framework

This contains the codes used in article:
"The influence of non-random species-sampling on macroevolutionary and macroecological inference from phylogenies"
by Xia Hua and Robert Lanfear

Please cite the article if you use the codes.

The codes implement our proposed correction for non-random sampling under the BiSSE framework.

To use the codes, please follow instructions in demo.R.

This will instruct you on how to replicate the results in the article and how to correct for non-random sampling in your own tree and sampling pattern.
